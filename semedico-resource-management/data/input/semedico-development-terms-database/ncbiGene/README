Use the 'createTestData.sh' script to automatically call the other scripts
(makeTestGene*) that create smaller versions of the original resource
files, respectively. The input file 'gene_ids_test_docs.lst' was created
by the Semedico-App using the CPE descriptor 'CPE-Extract-Test-GeneIds.xml'
and then just cut'ing out the second column of the result file (that
will perhaps be stored under the semedico-app/target directory when you
let run the CPE).
