This is a manually selected subset of the original Semedico facet terms
from 2009. They lie here so they can be used to manually set up a Neo4j
database server. This is done by either downloading Neo4j from neo4j.org,
adopting it for Semedico (most importantly putting the
julie-neo4j-server-plugins.jar into there) or taking the preconfigured
(but possibly outdated) Semedico Neo4j from our NFS at
/data/essentials/semedico/test-resources/. Then, use the script
'prepareSemedicoTestDatabase.sh' at the root of this project to
populate the database with the test data found in this directory.
