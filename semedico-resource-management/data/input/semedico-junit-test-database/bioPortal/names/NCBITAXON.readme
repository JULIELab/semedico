The term with ID 'http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/NCBITAXON/37733'
has been added because there also is a Gene with ID 37733. Thus, this
case is here to test whether we can successfully differentiate between
the two. There is no automatic test for this, it should just be checked
in the database. Unfortunately, there is no species-gene pair in the
test documents where the IDs would match.
