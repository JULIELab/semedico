  <shortDescription></shortDescription>
  <description>Immunized T-lymphocytes which can directly destroy appropriate target cells. These cytotoxic lymphocytes may be generated in vitro in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), in vivo during a graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction, or after immunization with an allograft, tumor cell or virally transformed or chemically modified target cell. The lytic phenomenon is sometimes referred to as cell-mediated lympholysis (CML). These CD8-positive cells are distinct from natural killer cells (KILLER CELLS, NATURAL) and from KILLER CELLS mediating antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. There are two effector phenotypes: TC1 and TC2.</description>

Instead, they hold antigen in the form of immune complexes on their surfaces for long periods and can present antigen to B cells during an immune response.</description>
