/**
 * <p>
 * This compares two instances of the MeSH and determines the modifications that lead from <code>source</code> to
 * <code>target</code>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some notes about the determined operations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>in general two runs might lead to different results. This is because there is no garantuee that the tree is
 * traversed in the same order each time, thus possibly leading to different results.</li>
 * <li><code>DescAdditions</code> allows to store vertex additions in new descriptors as well, however for the sake of
 * minimal ambiguity, we chose to store all vertex additions in <code>VertexAdditions</code>.</li>
 * <li>If there is an descriptor deletion, the corresponding vertex deletions are always separately stored in
 * <code>VertexDeletions</code> as well.</li>
 * <li>vertex renamings and descriptor renamings includes <i>all</i> changes of vertex names and descriptor UIs,
 * respectively. That includes those resulting from moving. Thus, vertex renamings and descriptor renamings indicate
 * whether a vertex and descriptor got substantially changed or not.</li> *
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation notes:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>vertex renamings and descriptor renamings key sets include a key for <i>every</i> vertex and descriptor in
 * <code>target</code>. This is because they are used as a uniform way to access the name of a vertex / UI of a
 * descriptor in <code>source</code> by its name / UI in target. Thus, also for names / UIs that didn't change or refer
 * to a new vertex / descriptor, there is a renaming from its name / UI to the same name / UI.</li>
 * <li>vertex renamings also track which vertices have been processed already - in <code>source</code> and in
 * <code>target</code>! We can check <code>vertexRenamings.containsOld()</code> to find out whether a certain vertex in
 * <code>source</code> was found to be the equivalent vertex in <code>target</code>. And we can check
 * <code>vertexRenamings.containsNew()</code> to find out whether we already processed a tree vertex of
 * <code>target</code></li>
 * <li>these unnecessary renamings are removed in the end of the comparison process.</li>
 * <li>
 * <code>!vertexRenamings.containsOld(v_source.getName())</code> is the typical statement in
 * <code>restoreAddsAndMovings(TreeVertex v_target)</code> to check a candidate modification. We may not overwrite any
 * previously made renamings, since we would have to find a new origin for the vertex that was the new name of the
 * renaming that would be overwritten. Or in short: overwriting a renaming means deleting a previously determined
 * modification. However, we need to determine exactly one modification for each call of
 * <code>restoreAddsAndMovings(TreeVertex v_target)</code>.
 * </ul>
