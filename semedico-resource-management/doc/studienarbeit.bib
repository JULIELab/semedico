  abstract = {Investigates the influence of the cost function on the optimal match
	between two graphs. It is shown that, for a given cost function,
	there are an infinite number of other cost functions that lead, for
	any given pair of graphs, to the same optimal error correcting matching.
	Furthermore, it is shown that well-known concepts from graph theory,
	such as graph isomorphism, subgraph isomorphism, and maximum common
	subgraph, are special cases of optimal error correcting graph matching
	under particular cost functions},

  url = {http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshrels.html},
  abstract = {Recent efforts to make some of the relationships within MeSH more
	explicit have led to a deeper understanding of the nature of these
	relationships. This chapter will explore the relationships represented
	in MeSH in the light of that understanding. Every term that occurs
	may be thought of as representing a concept. One or more terms, comprising
	one or more concepts, grouped together for important reasons, form
	a descriptor class. The descriptor class is the basic building block
	of the thesaurus. Relationships among concepts can be represented
	explicitly in the thesaurus, most notably as relationships within
	the descriptor class. Hierarchical relationships are at the level
	of the descriptor class. The hierarchies are key in allowing expanded
	retrievals. The hierarchical relationships, traditionally thought
	of as broader or narrower (parent-child) relationships, are better
	understood as representing broader and narrower retrieval sets. Nevertheless,
	these hierarchical relationships often reflect important broader-narrower
	relationships between preferred concepts in descriptor classes. Other
	types of relationships present in the thesaurus include associative
	relationships, such as the Pharmacologic Actions or see-related cross
	references, as well as forbidden combination expressions, such as
	the Entry Combination.},
