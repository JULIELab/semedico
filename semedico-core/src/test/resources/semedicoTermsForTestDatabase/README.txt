This is a manually selected subset of the original Semedico facet terms from 2009. They lie here so they can be used to manually set up a Neo4j database server. This is done by downloading Neo4j from neo4j.org and using the import function available for reading this format (as of creation of this file, this would be stemnet-tools - TermImport - with semedico-core-ontos (development branch) 1.8.0-SNAPSHOT).
