/**
 * <p>
 * This class is meant as a part of {@link SearchServerCommand}. It expresses data aggregation commands for the search
 * server. In some cases, aggregations can be seen as a 'group by'-like feature, however the approach is more general.
 * For example, the 'maximum' aggregation only returns the maximum value of a field (or even the document score), the
 * 'terms' aggregation is basically the term facets approach. This is heavily modeled after ElasticSearch aggregations.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Aggregations can be nested, so this class serves as a common super type for aggregation commands to allow flexible,
 * general nesting.
