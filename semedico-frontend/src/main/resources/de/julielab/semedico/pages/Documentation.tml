        <p><span class="properName">SeMedico</span> is a <em>semantic search engine</em> for the life sciences.
        In this context, <i>semantic</i> refers to the system's knowledge of concepts concerning life sciences and their relations with each other as expressed in the system's citations. 
        In <span class="properName">SeMedico</span>, concepts are diseases, genes or proteins or further categories (see also section X for terminologies / ontologies).</p>
        <p>
        The terminologies and ontologies used for <span class="properName">SeMedico</span> arrange their concepts in a hierarchical
        manner ordered from general concepts to more specific items.
       	The concept <i>Nervous System Diseases</i> is a quite general category from which <i>Parkinson's Disease</i> is a specific kind.
       	<span class="properName">SeMedico</span> exploits this information in its citation analysis.
        Thus, when searching for nervous system diseases in <span class="properName">SeMedico</span>, mentions of Parkinson's will be included.
        </p> 
        <p>
        On top of this terminological analysis, <span class="properName">SeMedico</span> identifies a range of protein-protein-interactions (PPI)
        mentioned in the analyzed text.
        The documents in <span class="properName">SeMedico</span> are enriched with these semantic meta data and
        employed to find the semantically most relevant results.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span class="properName">SeMedico</span> searches citations from <span class="properName">MedLine</span> - the largest part of <span class="properName">PubMed</span> - and
        full texts taken from the open access portion of <span class="properName">PubMed Central</span>.

        <h1><a name="howtouse">How to use <span class="properName">SeMedico?</span></a></h1>
        <p>
        To find publications of interest, just begin to type a keyword into the search field on the index page, just as is done using Google, Bing etc.
        <span class="properName">SeMedico</span> will then suggest concepts from its knowledge base. The suggestions are ordered by semantic category. 
        If a suggestion is selected, it forms a query token and
        will be searched as one concept, even if it contains multiple words. If no suggestion seems adequate, the item under the special <i>keyword</i> category
        may be selected in which case the entered word is added to the query without resolving it to a concept. Finally, the user may just enter one or several words
        and start the search by hitting enter or clicking the <i>find</i> button. In this case, <span class="properName">SeMedico</span> will analyze the
        query for concepts automatically.
        <p>
        After a query has been sent, the document hits are presented in bins of 10 hits. Some of the text portions causing the hit are displayed together with the
        title and bibliographical details about the citation. The text snippets are typically complete sentences to allow quick assessment of the hit. The snippets are
        highlighted to prominently show words, concepts and even semantic relations that matched the query. For PPIs, all elements of the relation are highlighted, i.e.
        arguments (genes/proteins), relation types (e.g. regulation, bindings etc.) and confidence clues (e.g. <i>maybe</i>, <i>the data suggest that</i>) modifying the
        respective PPI.

        <h1><a name="processedDocuments">Which documents are processed by <span class="properName">SeMedico?</span></a></h1>
        <p><span class="properName">SeMedico</span> runs on the entire <span class="properName">MedLine</span> collection, currently (as of December 2015) 
        more than 25M documents. <span class="properName">MedLine</span> documents consist either of bibliographical entries, which include author names, 
        the title of the paper, the journal in which it appeared, etc., but also assorted keywords, that are either derived from the Medical Subject Headings 
        (<span class="properName">MeSH</span>) or deliberately chosen free-text descriptors. Furthermore, they include author-supplied abstracts, however not
        the full text. However, external links to full texts (e.g. purchasable at publishers’ websites) are provided, if available.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span class="properName">PubMed Central</span> documents, on the other hand, include not only the abstract of a publication but also the full text portion.
        The non-textual information pieces (audio or video information, photos, graphics, 
        tables, etc.) are available from within <span class="properName">SeMedico</span>.

        <h1><a name="semantics">What is the ‘semantics’ in a semantic search engine?</a></h1>
        <p>Formulating a reasonable query is, even for a domain expert, often a very challenging task. Two main problems have to be dealt with:
        the terminological variety in the domain of discourse and the various linguistic variations single terms may undergo.</p>
        <p>
        On the one hand, the terminological level addressed by a semantic search engine relates to alternative denotations of the same meaning unit 
        (so-called <em>synonyms</em>), such as ‘Appendicitis’ and ‘Blinddarmentzündung’ within one natural language or across different natural languages 
        (‘Blinddarmentzündung’ and ‘inflammation of the appendix’). On the other hand, it relates to semantic, mostly <em>taxonomic</em>, <em>relations</em> 
        that hold between terms, such as between a narrower term (e.g. ‘Appendicitis’) and a broader term (e.g. ‘inflammation’, or even ‘disease’).
        </p>
        <p>
        The linguistic variations address other forms of synonymous relations such as spelling variations (e.g. ‘Cortex’ or ‘Kortex’), 
        inflectional variants (e.g. ‘kidney’, ‘kidney’s’, ‘kidneys’) and long and short forms (e.g. ‘electroencephalogram’ and ‘EEG’). 
        </p>
        <p>
        Rather than letting searchers anticipate (or sometimes just guess) all these variants while a search query is being formulated – 
        an approach which has repeatedly been shown in experiments to fail –, semantic search engines are designed in such a way so that they 
        automatically compensate for both the terminological as well as linguistic variety of natural language and normalize these mostly 
        synonymous variants. In effect, one mention of a variant form in a query leads to the identification of all other synonyms in the course 
        of the document search.

        <h1><a name="termOrigin">Where do the Terminologies originate from?</a></h1>
        <p>
            <span class="properName">SeMedico</span>’s terminological system has its roots in multiple resources. One massively exploited resource is 
            the <span class="properName">MeSH</span> taxonomy. For suggestion display, all categories but ‘Genes and Proteins’, ‘Gene Ontology’ and 
            ‘Gene Regulation Ontoloy’ (see below) were derived from the <span class="properName">MeSH</span> Main Headings and Supplementary Concepts. 
            To reflect the focus on biological foundations of medicine, some parts of the <span class="properName">MeSH</span> Main Headings
            were partly regrouped to grant an easier understanding of the shown categories for suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
        In particular, the ‘Genes and Proteins’ facet was not taken from the <span class="properName">MeSH</span> but rather originates from 
        <span class="properName">NCBI Gene</span> and was imported into <span class="properName">SeMedico</span> with a filter to restrict the displayed 
        terms to those actually accessible by <span class="properName">SeMedico</span>’s employed classifier for genes, 
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19188193" target="_blank"><span class="properName">GeNo</span></a>. In order to create a taxonomical 
        access to gene terms, cross-species gene terms were created. Each of these cross-species terms assembles the terms for the same gene in different 
        organisms. For example, to summarize the terms ‘IL2 (Homo Sapiens)’, ‘IL2 (Mus Musculus)’, ‘IL2 (Ovis aries)’ etc., a new term ‘IL2 (any organism)’ 
        was created. Selecting this term triggers a search of ‘IL2’ independent of concrete species. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The ‘Gene Ontology’ and ‘Gene Regulation’ ontologies were integrated from <a href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org/" target="_blank">
        <span class="propertyName">BioPortal</span></a>. They are well-known ontologies and fitting extensions to the MeSH-based facets. They also 
        deliver the semantic foundation of the PPI types for which Semedico offers search capabilities.
